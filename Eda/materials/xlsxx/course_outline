Course Duration -  4 Hrs

Minimum time to be dedicated for learning is 4 Hrs includes videos & reading material.

 

Course Description

It's not very often that you encounter data that will readily yield insights. In fact, 70% of the time while working with data is being spent in preparing the data for feature analysis. Data derived from various sources comes with its own challenges of format, missing values and extreme values. It is very elementary and very crucially to acknowledge the reliability of data and ensure normalization. This milestone in the Data Science cycle is a key enabler in deriving at the best possible Corpus for analysis and model building. This course will enable you to identify these impediments and assist you to overcome them. 

 

Course Objectives

After completing this course, you will be able to:
